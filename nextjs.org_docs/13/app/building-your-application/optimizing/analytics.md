# Analytics

[Next.js Speed Insights](https://nextjs.org/analytics) allows you to analyze and measure the performance of pages using different metrics.

You can start collecting your [Real Experience Score](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/speed-insights#core-web-vitals-explained?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website) with zero-configuration on [Vercel deployments](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/speed-insights?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website).

The rest of this documentation describes the built-in relayer Next.js Speed Insights uses.

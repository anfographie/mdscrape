# Form

The `<Form>` component extends the HTML `<form>` element to provide **client-side navigation** on submission, and **progressive enhancement**.

It's useful for forms that update URL search params as it reduces the boilerplate code needed to achieve the above.

Basic usage:

/ui/search.js

TypeScript

JavaScriptTypeScript

```
import Form from 'next/form'
 
export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Form action="/search">
      {/* On submission, the input value will be appended to
          the URL, e.g. /search?query=abc */}
      <input name="query" />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </Form>
  )
}
```

## [Reference](#reference)

The behavior of the `<Form>` component depends on whether the `action` prop is passed a `string` or `function`.

- When `action` is a **string**, the `<Form>` behaves like a native HTML form that uses a **`GET`** method. The form data is encoded into the URL as search params, and when the form is submitted, it navigates to the specified URL. In addition, Next.js:
  
  - Performs a [client-side navigation](/docs/15/app/getting-started/linking-and-navigating#client-side-transitions) instead of a full page reload when the form is submitted. This retains shared UI and client-side state.

### [`action` (string) Props](#action-string-props)

When `action` is a string, the `<Form>` component supports the following props:

PropExampleTypeRequired`action``action="/search"``string` (URL or relative path)Yes`replace``replace={false}``boolean`-`scroll``scroll={true}``boolean`-

- **`action`** : The URL or path to navigate to when the form is submitted.
  
  - An empty string `""` will navigate to the same route with updated search params.
- **`replace`** : Replaces the current history state instead of pushing a new one to the [browser's history](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API) stack. Default is `false`.
- **`scroll`** : Controls the scroll behavior during navigation. Defaults to `true`, this means it will scroll to the top of the new route, and maintain the scroll position for backwards and forwards navigation.

### [Caveats](#caveats)

- **`onSubmit`** : Can be used to handle form submission logic. However, calling `event.preventDefault()` will override `<Form>` behavior such as navigating to the specified URL.
- **[`method`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form#method), [`encType`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form#enctype), [`target`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form#target)**: Are not supported as they override `<Form>` behavior.
  
  - Similarly, `formMethod`, `formEncType`, and `formTarget` can be used to override the `method`, `encType`, and `target` props respectively, and using them will fallback to native browser behavior.
  - If you need to use these props, use the HTML `<form>` element instead.
- **`<input type="file">`** : Using this input type when the `action` is a string will match browser behavior by submitting the filename instead of the file object.

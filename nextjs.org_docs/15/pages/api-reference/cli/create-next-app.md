## [Examples](#examples)

### [With the default template](#with-the-default-template)

To create a new app using the default template, run the following command in your terminal:

Terminal

```
npx create-next-app@latest
```

You will then be asked the following prompts:

Terminal

```
What is your project named?  my-app
Would you like to use TypeScript?  No / Yes
Which linter would you like to use?  ESLint / Biome / None
Would you like to use Tailwind CSS?  No / Yes
Would you like your code inside a `src/` directory?  No / Yes
Would you like to use App Router? (recommended)  No / Yes
Would you like to use Turbopack? (recommended)  No / Yes
Would you like to customize the import alias (`@/*` by default)?  No / Yes
```

### [Linter Options](#linter-options)

**ESLint**: The traditional and most popular JavaScript linter. Includes Next.js-specific rules from `eslint-plugin-next`.

**Biome**: A fast, modern linter and formatter that combines the functionality of ESLint and Prettier. Includes built-in Next.js and React domain support for optimal performance.

**None**: Skip linter configuration entirely. You can always add a linter later.

> **Note**: `next lint` command will be deprecated in Next.js 16. New projects should use the chosen linter directly (e.g., `biome check` or `eslint`).

Once you've answered the prompts, a new project will be created with your chosen configuration.

### [With an official Next.js example](#with-an-official-nextjs-example)

To create a new app using an official Next.js example, use the `--example` flag. For example:

Terminal

```
npx create-next-app@latest --example [example-name] [your-project-name]
```

You can view a list of all available examples along with setup instructions in the [Next.js repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples).

### [With any public GitHub example](#with-any-public-github-example)

To create a new app using any public GitHub example, use the `--example` option with the GitHub repo's URL. For example:

Terminal

```
npx create-next-app@latest --example "https://github.com/.../" [your-project-name]
```

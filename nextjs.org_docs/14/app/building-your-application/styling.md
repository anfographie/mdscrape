# Styling

Next.js supports different ways of styling your application, including:

- **Global CSS**: Simple to use and familiar for those experienced with traditional CSS, but can lead to larger CSS bundles and difficulty managing styles as the application grows.
- **CSS Modules**: Create locally scoped CSS classes to avoid naming conflicts and improve maintainability.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid custom designs by composing utility classes.
- **Sass**: A popular CSS preprocessor that extends CSS with features like variables, nested rules, and mixins.
- **CSS-in-JS**: Embed CSS directly in your JavaScript components, enabling dynamic and scoped styling.

Learn more about each approach by exploring their respective documentation:
